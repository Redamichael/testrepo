# Week ONE

About the assignments
About the assignments: 
To achieve a passing grade in this course, you need to:

achieve a minimum score of 75% in the graded peer reviews in Week 1 (Brief 1.1: Explorations in Imagemaking) and Week 4 (Brief 4.1: Single Contrasts),

complete a minimum of 4 peer evaluations in those peer reviews,

achieve a minimum score of 80% on the quizzes in Week 2 (Typography) and Week 3 (Shape and Color).

As mentioned previously, there are plenty of additional optional, ungraded assignments in this course. To really develop your skills as a designer I strongly encourage you participate in all the optional assignments, as well as the required assignments, including the recommended number of extra peer reviews.

n this course there may be some auto-graded quizzes, but most of the work you’ll be doing is completing open-ended assignments graded through peer review in order to emulate the group critique that is the hallmark of much of the teaching that happens at CalArts.

A peer reviewed assignment consists of two parts: the submission and the review. You must complete the assignment successfully according to the assignment instructions, and then review the minimum number of peers using the provided rubric. You will receive a grade on your assignment plus feedback from your peers after you have completed both parts.



# Forum Guidelines

The forums are a place for learners to talk to each other about the course and graphic design in general. Please take a minute to read this quick guide before you post.

What to post to the forums:
Questions about the content of the course: If you are having trouble understanding an assignment or one of the videos, post your question in the relevant week. CalArts staff check the forums regularly and will be able to help.

Problems with the content of the course: If a link is broken or you are having trouble accessing any of the supplemental content, post in the relevant week. This does not include issues with the Coursera platform.

Review requests: If you are having trouble getting peer reviews, there is a pinned thread in each week where you can post a link to your assignment.

Interesting content: If you find something graphic design related that you like, or just want to talk about a piece of work that isn’t covered in the course, feel free to post about it! Just remember that this is a course about graphic design and stay on topic.

What not to post to the forums:
Technical issues: If something is not working with the Coursera platform (for example you are having trouble accessing or submitting an assignment) you should check to see if your problem is covered at the Learner Help Center. To access the FAQs there, click on the question mark in the bottom right of your screen. If your issue is not covered in the Learner Help Center the next step is to contact Coursera Support.

Problems with plagiarism: If you find that someone has submitted an assignment that is not their own work, flag it and Coursera staff will take a look at it. If you feel that one of your assignments was wrongly flagged for plagiarism, contact Coursera Support.

Problems with certificates: After completing the course it can take a day or two to be able to access your certificate. If after that time has passed you are still unable to get to it, contact Coursera Support.

Additionally, please do not post anything on the forums that will violate the Coursera Code of Conduct.

Sticking to these guidelines will help ensure that everyone has a good experience on the forums and that all questions are answered in a timely manner. Thanks for reading!


# Requesting Peer Reviews:

Peer review assignments are a way for learners to get feedback on open-ended assignments and projects. Sometimes this process can take a day or two, depending on how many peers are in the course.

If two days have passed and you are still having trouble getting the peer reviews you need to pass an assignment, you can post in the forums to request a review. In this course however, we ask that you follow these guidelines to keep the forums organized and ensure that everyone’s request is seen in a timely manner.

Submit your request by replying to the original post in the pinned thread, rather than creating a new post.

In your request, be sure to include the link to your submitted assignment, and not any other link. Tip: the URL will look something like this: https://www.coursera.org/learn/course-title/peer/somenumbers/assignment-title/review/...

Post review requests only for the particular assignment named in the thread, and only once. Multiple posts for the same assignment clutter up the thread and make it harder for other learners to get reviews.

Refrain from posting content unrelated to review requests in the pinned thread.

As always, please follow the Coursera Code of Conduct when posting.

Finally, do consider reviewing more than the minimum number of reviews to help your fellow classmates get thoughtful and timely feedback. Click the “Most Recent” tab within the pinned post to see the newest replies.

Following these guidelines will ensure a smooth experience for all learners, and will help ensure that all requests, and questions about course content, can be seen more easily. Any review requests that don’t follow these guidelines may be deleted by CalArts staff.

Thanks for your cooperation!



# Image making

	- Denotative image: The image represents the thing itself(literal depiction)
	- Connotative image: Pair an image with an other element

# Techniques of Image Making
	- Think how you become clever, inventive and interesting than refined and polished. 
	- Start simple
	- made with has a great effect on what the image looks like and how the image feels.
	- Another aspect of image-making to think about is cropping. What this means is how close up to or how far away you are from your image, and this determines exactly what you're gonna see of the image.
	- Other aspects are: line, color, volume,..
	- Visual experimentation is key: You're really testing when is this image going to break down, and stop being readable as the object that it was intended to be readable as. When does this apple stop being an apple?
	- Another aspect is to think of Texture
	- one of the things that can accentuate the texture of an object or of an illustration can be a contrast
	- MIX IT UP
 	- Three important aspects of image making: 
		-process - how you make images, the steps that you take in order to make them.
			-  process driven image making really lets you experiment along the way, quite often without an idea of what the final outcome is gonna be.
			- You could have a rough idea of what you think is gonna happen or how you might want the image to feel, but the exact details are really down to the process itself.
		- iteration - is just that you make a lot of variations of the same thing
		- generation -  is just making as many objects as you can, just trying to continually make and to learn from that making as a continual process.
			- Part of this is about acknowledging that there's no single correct way to make an image.
